### This project uses Power BI Desktop and Excel to help businesses growth substantially through revenue optimization.

#### Key Features
* RevPAR: RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.
* ADR:
   * It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold.
   * It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period

### Key Insights:
* RevPAR is a byproduct of rate and occupany(RevPar is changing as Occupany is changing). but looking at the this date it is envident that this hotel does not the use any pricing strategy as the ADR is not fluctuating. (Recommanded to use dynamic pricing strategy)

* A hostel with a lower rating is less likely to be occupied, meaning the occupancy rate is very low when the average rating is 3 or less.

* Lower-rated hostels experience higher cancellation rates across platforms, often due to mismatched expectations and other issues, highlighting the Pareto principle's observation of significant impact from a minority of properties.

  #### Note: In the hotel industry, 80% of the revenue typically comes from 20% of the top-performing hostels, while 80% of the complaints and issues often originate from 20% of the lowest-rated hostels, emphasizing the need to focus on both high-value properties and problematic ones for overall improvement.
